# 🎁 GiftSTX Smart Contract

**GiftSTX** is a **Clarity-based** smart contract on the **Stacks blockchain** that allows users to send **STX tokens as gifts** with **time-locked** or **conditional** withdrawals. This ensures secure, trustless, and automated gifting.

## 🚀 Features

- **STX Gifting**: Send STX tokens as a gift to another wallet.
- **Time-Locked Withdrawals**: Set a future date for when recipients can claim their gifts.
- **Conditional Unlocking**: Define custom conditions for releasing funds.
- **Secure & Transparent**: Utilizes Clarity’s **predictable execution model** for safety.
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient contract execution to minimize transaction costs.

## 🏗️ Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- [Stacks CLI](https://docs.hiro.so/get-started/installing) installed  
- Clarity development environment (`clarinet`)  

### Steps to Deploy
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/giftstx-smart-contract.git
   cd giftstx-smart-contract
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   clarinet check
   ```
3. Deploy the contract on a local testnet:
   ```sh
   clarinet deploy
   ```

## 📝 Usage

### Sending a Gift:
1. Call the `send-gift` function with:
   - **Recipient Address**: The wallet address of the recipient.
   - **Amount**: The STX amount to be gifted.
   - **Unlock Time (optional)**: A UNIX timestamp defining when the gift can be claimed.
   - **Custom Condition (optional)**: A condition that must be met for claiming.

### Claiming a Gift:
- The recipient calls `claim-gift` once the unlock time has passed or conditions are met.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Funds remain locked** in the contract until released to the recipient.
- **No premature withdrawals**—only recipients can claim when conditions are met.
- **Clarity’s predictability** ensures transparency and safety.
